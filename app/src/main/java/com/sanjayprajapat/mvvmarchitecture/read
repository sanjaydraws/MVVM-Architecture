what are lifecycle-aware-components


How does it work



what are lifecycleowner &
LifecycleOwner(can call any Activity/Fragment)

Activity Has Lifecycle when comes to archietecture component we have
Lifecycle class (Which uses Event and State to determine the Lifecycle of LifeCyleOwner)
Eache event has own state, EACH EVENT IS TO PAarticular state
  onCreate()  ->CREATED
  onStart()-> STARTED
  onPause()->  PAUSED
  onResume() -> RESUMED
  onDestroy()-> DESTROYED
  onStop()-> STOPPED

Lifecycle class - holds info about lifecycle of LifecycleOwner
lifecycle object uses following enumeration to track lifecycle status

LIFECYCLEOWNER -> provide lifecycle status to lifecycl-aware-components
lifecycleObserver -> it register lifecycle status to respond and perform action

LifecycleObserver -> which observes this activity,and keep track of it's lifecycle
LifecycleObserver perform action and action performed by this lifecycleObserver
depends on the lifecycle of lifecycle owner


Handling Lifecycles with Lifecycle-Aware Components
it perform action in when change the lifecycle status of component such as activities and fragments
Lifecycles are managed by the operating system or the framework code running in your process.


activity and observer
 D/MAInACT: onCreate: OWNER
 D/MAInACT: onCreate: OBSERVER androidx.lifecycle.LifecycleRegistry@9bfa842
 D/MAInACT: onStart: Owner
 D/MAInACT: onStart: OBSERVER androidx.lifecycle.LifecycleRegistry@9bfa842
 D/MAInACT: onResume: Owner
 D/MAInACT: onResume: OBSERVER androidx.lifecycle.LifecycleRegistry@9bfa842



when lock app , when app is visible , goes in background
D/MAInACT: onPause: OBSERVER androidx.lifecycle.LifecycleRegistry@9bfa842
D/MAInACT: onPause: Owner
D/MAInACT: onStop: OBSERVER androidx.lifecycle.LifecycleRegistry@9bfa842
D/MAInACT: onStop: Owner

when open lock app ,
D/MAInACT: onStart: Owner
D/MAInACT: onStart: OBSERVER androidx.lifecycle.LifecycleRegistry@9bfa842
D/MAInACT: onResume: Owner
D/MAInACT: onResume: OBSERVER androidx.lifecycle.LifecycleRegistry@9bfa842

when kill app
onDestroy: OBSERVER androidx.lifecycle.LifecycleRegistry@9bfa842
D/MAInACT: onDestroy: Owner
